### Physics-Informed Diffusion Model for Real-Time Satellite Weather Nowcasting

AtmosGen is a research-oriented AI system designed for short-term weather nowcasting using satellite imagery.  
It integrates generative diffusion modeling with physics-informed constraints to produce physically consistent and probabilistic predictions of future atmospheric motion.

The system focuses on 0–2 hour satellite frame forecasting using deep generative models rather than traditional numerical weather simulation.

## Motivation

Short-term forecasting (nowcasting) plays a critical role in:

- Severe storm detection
- Flood risk monitoring
- Aviation safety
- Disaster response systems
- Climate monitoring

Conventional approaches rely on:

1. Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) — computationally expensive
2. ConvLSTM-style deep learning — lacks physical consistency
3. Optical flow extrapolation — limited temporal stability

AtmosGen bridges these methods by combining generative modeling with physics-aware learning.

## Problem Definition

Given a sequence of satellite observations:

F₁, F₂, F₃, ..., Fₙ

AtmosGen predicts:

Fₙ₊₁, Fₙ₊₂, ..., Fₙ₊ₖ

While enforcing:

- Spatial coherence
- Temporal smoothness
- Physically plausible motion
- Stable cloud evolution
- Uncertainty-aware outputs

## Methodology

AtmosGen integrates:

• A UNet-based latent diffusion architecture  
• Self-attention mechanisms for extreme weather regions  
• Optical-flow consistency regularization  
• Physics-inspired residual loss functions  
• Monte Carlo sampling for uncertainty estimation  

Instead of purely data-driven training, the model embeds motion constraints to encourage realistic atmospheric dynamics.
